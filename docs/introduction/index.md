### **Navigating Homelessness: Class #1**

We begin the semester by discussing two pieces from the New Yorker that capture the day-to-day challenges of those experiencing homelessness as well as the providers who work with them. These stories highlight a number of issues that we'll discuss further in the semester such as mental health, substance abuse, financial costs and supportive services. A common refrain is that homelessness is a housing problem. These stories though show that homelessness is a culmination of a number of issues and perhaps none more important than strong and healthy relationships.

### **Rough Sleepers: Class #2 & #4**

I was asked in a recent job interview, if I was teaching a course on poverty, what paper would I begin the class with. The short answer is that I wouldn’t. I wouldn’t begin a class with a paper. That isn’t to say papers aren’t important, or aren’t worth reading. But I’d start with a book -  with a story, with something that captures one’s attention and holds it and says ‘this is something important’, ‘here’s what some people’s daily lives look like’. And something that asks, by the end, and ‘what are you going to do about it?!’ Papers don’t do that. Books do.

In this class, we start with Tracy Kidder's story of Dr. Jim, the Street Team, Tony, the Moussey Park Crew, and the rest of the people that both serve and makeup Boston's Rough Sleeper population.

### **The Role of Economics: Class #3**

It's worthwhile at the start of the semester to try and get clarity on what insight Economics might offer on the broader issues surrounding housing and homelessness. Evans et al. (2019) gives us a jumping off point.

### **Leadership in Housing**

A lot of papers that we'll read examine the effectiveness of certain policies -- vouchers, legal aid, financial assistance and the like. Focusing exclusively on policies though can make it hard to appreciate the outsized role that good leadership plays not just in the execution of these policies but in the functioning of institutions such as HUD, Public Housing Authorities, and non-profit organizations. J. S. Fuerst's account on Public Housing reminds us of the importance of having great leadership.
