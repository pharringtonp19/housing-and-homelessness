### **Navigating Homelessness**

We begin the semester by discussing two pieces from the New Yorker that capture the day-to-day challenges of those experiencing homelessness as well as the providers who work with them. These stories capture a number of issues that we'll discuss further in the semester such as mental health, substance abuse, financial costs and supportive services. A common refrain is that homelessness is a housing problem. These stories though show that homelessness is a culmination of a number of issues and perhaps none more important than strong and healthy relationships.

### **Housing Issues**

In this class, we are introduced, by Conor Dougherty, to a number of issues surrounding housing from post WW2 onwards including the development of environmental concerns, property taxes (Prop 13), rent control, the financialization of housing, NIMBY, the gentrifying effects of upzoning, contract cities, among a host of other issues.

### **Leadership in Housing**

A lot of papers that we'll read examine the effectiveness of certain policies -- vouchers, legal aid, financial assistance and the like. Focusing exclusively on policies though can make it hard to appreciate the outsize role that good leadership plays not just in the execution of these policies but in the functioning of institutions such as HUD, Housing Authorities, to non-profit services. J. S. Fuerst's account on Public Housing illustrates the importance of having great leadership.
