### **Navigating Homelessness**

We begin the semester by discussing two pieces from the New Yorker that capture the day-to-day challenges of those experiencing homelessness as well as the providers who work with them. These stories capture a number of issues that we'll discuss further in the semester such as mental health, substance abuse, financial costs and supportive services. A common refrain is that homelessness is a housing problem. These stories though show that homelessness is a culmination of a number of issues and perhaps none more important than strong and healthy relationships.

In this class we disscuss Edward Glaeser's and Joseph Gyourko's piece on "Rethinking Federal Housing Policy". It's a nice starting point for the semester because it highlights how we can use the basic economic tools from Principle of Microeconomics to evaluate housing policy.
