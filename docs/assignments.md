## **Where Research Meets Practice**

The assignment is to interview someone who works for a company/non-profit organization within the broader realm of housing or homelessness. During this conversation, you should focus on what questions they are concerned about. 
Write a short essay both on the experience of finding someone to talk with, the questions that they have, and the feasibility of answering these questions using empirical methods. (Short Essay: 4-6 pages)

## **Looking for Insight**
When reading a economic paper, you may become interested/captivated in a point that the authors appear to miss or understate. For this assignment, you will rewrite the Abstract, Introduction and Conclusion 
in a way that better emphasizes the point of interest. (Abstract, Introduction and Conclusion: 3-6 pages)

## **Asking for Data**
A potentially underappreciated part of being an economist is the ability to have firms, non-profits, or governmental agencies share data with you (#AlwaysBeClosing). This assignment asks you to reach out to one of these organizations and ask them to share 
some data of interest. Write about the experience of securing the data as well why you think the data is interesting/important, and some takeway from running a regression on this dataset. (Empirical Exercise: 3-6 pages.)

## **Referee Report**
Write a referee report on a paper of your choosing. 
(Referee Report: 1-2 pages)

## **How It Was Made**
The assignment is to interview an author on a paper that we have read together as a class. Your aim here is to understand the challenges/obstacles that the author faced in developing the paper, to what extent they overcame the challenges, and the issues or limitations that remain with the work. (2-4 pages)
