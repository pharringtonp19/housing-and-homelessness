## **Two Referee Reports (10%)**
Write a referee report on a paper of your choosing. **Note**: this should be an opportunity for you to start to figure out which aspect of this course primarily interests you! 
(Referee Report: 1-2 pages)

## **Looking for Insight (10%)**
When reading a economic paper, you may become interested/captivated in a point that the authors appear to miss or understate. For this assignment, you will rewrite the Abstract, Introduction and Conclusion 
in a way that better emphasizes the point of interest. **Note**: this assignment may help you better narrow down your topic of interest for your research paper. (Abstract, Introduction and Conclusion: 3-6 pages)

## **Asking for Data (15%)**
A potentially underappreciated part of being an economist is the ability to have firms, non-profits, or governmental agencies share data with you (#AlwaysBeClosing). 
This assignment asks you to reach out to one of these organizations and ask them to share some data of interest. 
Write about the experience of securing the data as well why you think the data is interesting/important. Also, include one plot or regression output using the data. **Note**: The aim here is to acquire a data set that you could use in your research paper. (Empirical Exercise: 3-6 pages.)


## **How It Was Made  (15%)**
The assignment is to interview an author on a paper that we have read together as a class. Your aim here is to understand the challenges/obstacles that the author faced in developing the paper, to what extent they overcame the challenges, and the issues or limitations that remain with the work. **Note**: This report should be technical in nature.
When you dig into the challenges, hightlight the technical issues. Maybe the author tried a difference-difference approach intially, but that didn't work because the pre-trends weren't convincing. Or maybe the author wanted to use an IV approach, but the exclusion restriction didn't hold in a convincing way. The target audience for this report should be a fellow economist. (4-6 pages) 


## **Final Research Paper (40%)**
Hopefully, all the previous assignment should help you build up the research paper throughout the semester. From identify your research question of interest, to acquiring data, to understanding the challenges of producing economic research, you should be in a position to produce some insights of your own.
