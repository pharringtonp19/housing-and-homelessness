### **Class # 5**
In this class we focus on the relationship between low-income housing and the rest of the housing market. In particular, we focus on Mast (2021) who empirically highlights the migration chains that result from the development of high-income housing.

### **Class # 6**
In this class we discuss the impacts of rent control policies. Most undergrads are comfortable with explaining the impact of rent control (a price ceiling). Diamond et al. (2019) attempts to provide additional insight to this topic by leveraging consumer reference data and a quasi-experimental design. We discuss the relative strenghts of this work. This is one of those works where I think the credibility of the results would have been strengthened by a more transparent discussion of the limitations of the context & data.
