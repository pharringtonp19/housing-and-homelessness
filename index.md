### **Overview**
This sophmore tutorial will focus on issues related to housing for low-income individuals and families. It will consider both macroeconomic factors relating to the supply of housing, as well as microeconomic factors concerning housing stability and insecurity such as the role of legal aid in preventing evictions. While focused in nature, the seminar will also touch on issues related to incarceration, health care, and the opioid epidemic as they relate to housing. Given the large number of housing policies introduced in the wake of the pandemic, this seminar should be a fruitful starting point for those thinking of writing a senior thesis.
